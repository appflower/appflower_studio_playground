= sfCaptcha plugin =

The `sfCaptchaPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides captcha functionality based on JpGraph library.

It gives you the lib (incl. jpgraph antispam) and the module to secure your symfony forms in a minute with a good captcha.

== Installation ==

  * Install the plugin
  
  {{{
    symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfCaptchaPlugin
  }}}
  
  * Enable one or more modules in your `settings.yml` (optional)
    * sfCaptcha

  {{{
    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules:      [default, sfCaptcha]
  }}}

  * Put JpGraph core and antispam extension into lib folder or modify in
    Captcha.class.php the following line:

    * require_once 'jpgraph/jpgraph_antispam.php';

  * Clear you cache
  
  {{{
    symfony cc
  }}}

=== Secure your application ===

To secure a symfony form:

  * Optionally add the following routing rules to `routing.yml`

  {{{
    sf_captcha:
      url:   /captcha
      param: { module: sfCaptcha, action: index }
  }}}

  * Put the following lines inside of your form

      <img src="<?php echo url_for('@sf_captcha'); ?>" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <?php echo input_tag('captcha'); ?>

  * Put the following code into your form's validator yml file:

        methods:
          post:            [ captcha ]

        names:
  	  captcha:
	    required:      Yes
	    required_msg:  You should specify Turing number
	    validators:    captchaValidator


	captchaValidator:
	  class:         captchaValidator
	  param:
	    error: You should specify valid Turing number

  * Put the following code into the action which is for the form where captcha
    has to be presented:

        $g = new Captcha();
        $this->getUser()->setAttribute('captcha', $g->generate());

  * If you want to customize your captcha phrase please modify the following 
    method in lib/Captcha.class.php:

    	public function generate() {
      	  $this->iData = '';
      	  for ($i = 0; $i < 5; ++$i) 
 	    $this->iData .= chr(ord('1') + rand(0,8));

      	  return $this->iData;	
    	}

  * You're done. Now, if you try to access a secured form, you will be asked to type in captcha.
